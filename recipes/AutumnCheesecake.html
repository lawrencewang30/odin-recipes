    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers.
    The main, and thickets, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese
    (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar.
    If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made
    from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes
    sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated).
    </p>
    <p>Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in different ways,
    such as vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, and pumpkin, which are put in the main cheese
    layer. Additional flavors/visual appeal may be added via topping the finished dessert with
    fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, and more. In this recipe
    we are making an Autumn Cheesecake, which is basically apple cheesecake, and should give off
    that feeling of fall time, hence the word "Autumn"
