    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A double cheesburger is a hamburger with 2 meat patties
    with each topped with cheese. The cheese is usually added to the
    cooking burger patties shortly before serving, which allows the cheese
    slices to melt. There are different variations of ingredients and condiments
    used, and it may include toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles,
    bacon, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.
    </p>
    <p>This is sold in many fast food restaurants, and the cheeses
    they use is usually processed cheese. However, other meltable cheeses
    may be used as alternatives, such as cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella,
    blue cheese, and pepper jack. Some fast food restaurants include McDonald's, Burger 
    King, and Wendy's. This recipe will be a homemade version, which utilizes
    natural ingredients and should be of higher value.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Original recipe yielding 1 serving</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li>
        <li>1/3 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 processed cheese singles (ex: Kraft®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing (ex: Kraft®)</li>
        <li>1 slice tomato</li>
        <li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast both halves
            of the hamburger bun, cut sides down, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger
            than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip
            patties over and immediately place two slices of cheese on each one. Cook until meat
            has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted
            into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
