    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Coney Island hot dog (or Coney dog, Coney) is a hot dog
    in a bun topped with a savory meat sauce and sometimes
    other toppings. It is often offered as part of a menu
    of classic American "diner" dishes and often at Coney
    Island restaurants. It is largely a phenomenon related
    to immigration from Greece and the region of Macedonia
    to the United States in the early 20th century.
    </p>
    <p>There are different states that have different
    interpretations about the hot dog. It is very prevalent
    in a Detroit Tiger game, a baseball team in Michigan.
    The recipe we have will be pertained specifically
    to the Detroit-Style Coney Dog, nicknamed the
    "Detroit Coney"
